Jeopardy is a television quiz show where three contestants compete by
responding to general knowledge clues.
Their responses must be in the form of a question.
The daily syndicated version of the show has been on the air since 1984.

This paper is an analysis of data from the game show.

#### Game Description

The show has two rounds and a final.
Each round has 6 categories and within each category there are 5 clues.
The clues have increasing dollar amounts with a category.
If a player gives the correct answer to a clues, that dollar amount
is added to their score.
Incorrect answers result in subtraction of that dollar amount.

The final jeopardy clue ends the game.
The players are told the category and they can wager as much of their score.
The players have 30 seconds to write down their response once the final clue
is shown.
Players with a correct response get their wager added to their score,
incorrect responses result in subtraction of the wager amount.
The player with the highest score wins that amount in dollars and
plays in the next day's game against two new players.

Data from the Jeopardy games are are available on the Internet.
It includes information about the players:
names, home city, number of games played, winnings, etc.
This analysis does not look at the content of the game questions (answers)
which are also available on the site.

#### Purpose of This Analysis
This document is an example of a data analysis
using Open Source R.

This is a reproducible analysis.
All code to recreate the analysis, from getting the data,
cleaning it, computing summaries, to creating graphics is included.
This means that the analysis can be rerun at a future time after more Jeopardy games have been played
and the results of those games are posted to the Internet.
The code for is available on Github at
[https://github.com/spkal/jeopardy](https://github.com/spkal/jeopardy).

This is also an exercise in using the `dplyr` package [@R-dplyr]
for data cleanup and manipulation and
using the `ggplot2` package [@R-ggplot2] for creating graphics
We make extensive use of the new pipe operator (`%>%`)
that was introduced with the `dplyr` package.

Those key packages are loaded here.
```{r}
library(ggplot2, quietly= TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, quietly= TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

## The Data
### Getting the Data
The data was scraped from the
[http://www.j-archive.com site](http://www.j-archive.com) site
using the `whatr` package from [Github](https://github.com/kiernann/whatr).

The data was cleaned and the regular Jeopardy play data was
saved in an R object.
We load that data here.
```{r read_data}
dfile <- "reg_game_player_score.rds"
dpath <- here::here(file.path("data", dfile))
jeopardyData <- readRDS(dpath)
```

The dataset had `r ncol(jeopardyData)`  variables:
```{r}
names(jeopardyData)
```
The complete dataset for analysis has a single player in a game as the basic observation
i.e.  each row in the data set represents a single player in a game,
and each games consists of 3 rows.
So we have
`r nrow(jeopardyData)` rows and `r ncol(jeopardyData)` columns which make
`r nrow(jeopardyData)` player observations and
`r nrow(jeopardyData) / 3` games.
There are `r length(unique(jeopardyData$PlayerId))` unique players.
The games were played from
`r min(jeopardyData$Date)` to `r max(jeopardyData$Date)`.

## Analysis

### The Games

#### Answers

There are 6 categories x 5 clues per category x 2 rounds = 60 clues
in each game.

Due to time limitations, the players may not get to all of the clues.
The number of clues attempted in a game by a single player is
the sum of the number correct (`right`), the number wrong (`wrong`),
the number of daily doubles correct (`ddright`)
and the number of daily doubles wrong (`ddwrong`).

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) %>%
    with(summary(NumAttempted))
```

At least one player only attempted 2 clues and while another dominated
a game by trying 51.

A graphical view of the number of attempted clues:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(NumAttempted))) + 
        geom_bar() + xlab("Number Clues Attempted by a Player") +
        ggtitle("Distribution of Number of Clues Attempted by a Player")
```

The same graph, by gender:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(NumAttempted))) + 
        geom_bar() + xlab("Number Clues Attempted by a Player") +
        facet_grid(Gender ~ .) +
        ggtitle("Distribution of Clues Attempted by Gender")

```

Men tend to attempt more questions then women
and the range of values is wider for men including
some that attempt over 50 of the possible questions.

Note that the sum of `NumAttempted` across all three players in a game
is not the same as the total number of clues tried in that game
since after an incorrect response by a players,
another play can try to answer that same question.

The percentage of clues answers correctly by each player:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(PercentCorrect =
        (right + ddright) / (right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) * 100) %>%
    with(summary(PercentCorrect))
```
A density plot of the percent correct answers:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(PercentCorrect =
        (right + ddright) /
            (right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) * 100) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=PercentCorrect)) + 
        geom_density()
```

The most common percent correct values are between 82 and 90,
then it drops off but rises again at 100 percent.

Here is the distribution of attempted clues for those who always 
answer correctly compared to other players. We use a density plot
instead of counts since the total numbers in each group are vastly
different.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(NumAttempted = right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright,
        PercentCorrect = (right + ddright) /
            (right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) * 100,
        AlwaysRight = (PercentCorrect > 99)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = NumAttempted, color=AlwaysRight)) +
        geom_density() +
        xlab("Number of Clues Attempted") +
        ggtitle("Number Attempted for Perfect Player vs Other Players")
```

Most players who get all questions correct tend not to attempt as many questions as other players.

Here is the density of percent correct answers by gender:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
    mutate(PercentCorrect =
        (right + ddright) /
            (right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) * 100) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=PercentCorrect, color=Gender)) + 
        geom_density() +
        ggtitle("Density of Percent Correct by Gender")
```

We have the spike at 100 percent for both female and male players.
The female players have a slightly more spread out distribution
of percent correct
and their peak is slightly less than the peak for the male players.

#### Daily Doubles

There are 3 daily doubles in each game, one in the Jeopardy Round and
two in the Double Jeopardy round.
The player who gets the daily double questions 
can wager as much of their current score on the question.

The number of daily doubles found by players in a game:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    mutate(DDCount = ddwrong + ddright) %>%
    with(cbind(NumDD = 0:3, DDCount = table(DDCount),
       Percent =  round(table(DDCount) /  sum(table(DDCount)) * 100, 2))) 
```
The percentage of all daily doubles that are answered correctly is
`r 
jeopardyData %>%
    filter(ddwrong + ddright > 0) %>%
    summarise(Percentddright = round(sum(ddright) / sum(ddwrong + ddright) * 100, 2))
` percent.

#### Number of Final Jeopardy Players

If a player has a score of 0 or less at the end of the double jeopardy round,
that player is eliminated from the final jeopardy round.
The number of players in Final Jeopardy:

```{r}
NFinal <- jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    mutate(NumberInFinal = sum(SecondRoundScore > 0)) %>%
    summarise(NumberInFinal = first(NumberInFinal)) %>%
    with(table(NumberInFinal))
cbind(NumberOfPlayers=1:3, Count = NFinal,
    Percentage = round(NFinal / sum(NFinal) * 100, 2))
```

The shows with only one player left for Final Jeopardy:
```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    mutate(NumberInFinal = sum(SecondRoundScore > 0)) %>%
    filter(NumberInFinal == 1) %>%
    select(Date, Name, SecondRoundScore) %>%
    as.data.frame()
```

#### Runaways

A runaway game is when one player cannot be beat in Final Jeopardy.
This will occur when one player has at least twice the score of each of the
other players at the end of the Double Jeopardy round.

```{r}
isRunaway <- function(score) {
    score <- sort(score)
    all(score[3] >= 2*score[-3])
}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    summarise(Runaway = isRunaway(SecondRoundScore)) %>%
    with(c(NumberRunaways=sum(Runaway),
        PercentRunaways=round(sum(Runaway) / length(Runaway) * 100, 2)))
```

#### Ties
How often does the game end with multiple winners (i.e. a tie)?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    mutate(NumWinners = sum(IsWinner)) %>%
    summarise(NumWinners = first(NumWinners)) %>%
    with(cbind(Winners = 1:3, Count = table(NumWinners),
        Percent = round(table(NumWinners) / sum(NumWinners) * 100, 2)))
```

Most games have only one winner.
In two games, all three people had the same final score.

#### Comebacks

How often does the player with the lowest score
at the end of the double jeopardy round, win the game?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    mutate(IsComeback = (SecondRoundScore == min(SecondRoundScore))) %>%
    filter(IsWinner) %>%
    with(c(Count = sum(IsComeback),
        Percent = round(sum(IsComeback) / length(IsComeback) * 100, 2)))
```

#### Final Jeopardy Stumpers

How often do all the players miss the Final Jeopardy questions?
The data does not include any specific information about the Final Jeopardy question
or wager.
If the `FinalScore` is larger than the `SecondRoundScore`, we know the player answered
Final Jeopardy correctly. Similarly, if `FinalScore` is less than `SecondRoundScore`,
their response for Final Jeopardy was incorrect.
If the `FinalScore` is the same as the `SecondRoundScore`, we only know that the
player did not wager anything in Final Jeopardy, their response could have been correct or wrong.
So we only count those who made a wager in Final Jeopardy.

```{r}
isStumper <- function(score2, score3) {
    all(score3 < score2)
}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    filter(all(SecondRoundScore != FinalScore)) %>%
    summarise(IsStumper = isStumper(SecondRoundScore, FinalScore)) %>%
    with(c(Count = sum(IsStumper), Games = length(IsStumper),
        Percent = round(sum(IsStumper) / length(IsStumper) * 100, 2)))
```

#### Dollar Winnings in a Game


When looking at the dollar winnings for a game we need to look separately
at games before the dollar values doubled and after.

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    filter(IsWinner) %>%
    group_by(GameMaxValue) %>%
    summarize(AveWinnings=mean(FinalScore),
        MedianWinnings=median(FinalScore),
        MinWinnings=min(FinalScore),
        MaxWinnings=max(FinalScore)) %>%
    as.data.frame()
```

The mean and median winnings are both about doubled
when the dollar amounts doubled.

The shows where the winning score was 0:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    filter(IsWinner, FinalScore == 0) %>%
    select(Date, Name, FinalScore) %>%
    as.data.frame()
```

In one game, all 3 players won with 0
and in another game, two players tied with a score of 0.
Actually, none of the players were considered winners
since none of these players played in the next day's game.

A visual view of the distribution of the winnings:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
filter(jeopardyData, IsWinner) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=FinalScore)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000) +
    facet_grid(GameMaxValue ~ .) +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Game Winnings")
```

There are
`r filter(jeopardyData, GameMaxValue == "Max2000") %>% nrow()`
with GameMaxValue of Max2000
compared to only
`r filter(jeopardyData, GameMaxValue == "Max1000") %>% nrow()`
for Max1000.
It is no surprising that the spread of the FinalScore values
is larger for the Max2000 group.

### The Players

#### Number of Games Played

The `NumTimesOnShow` variable increases each time the player is on the show.
We want to look at the maximum value of `NumTimeOnShow` for each player:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
    with(summary(MaxNumGames))
```

Half the players only are on one show.
Which is not surprising since two players (usually) do not return.
One player was on 75 times.
We will investigate that player later.

Number of games played by gender:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
    group_by(Gender) %>%
    summarise(Min=min(MaxNumGames), Median=median(MaxNumGames),
        Mean=mean(MaxNumGames), Max=max(MaxNumGames)) %>%
	as.data.frame()
```

Looking at the players who won the most games (10 or more),
the Date is the date of their final game:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
        Date = max(Date)) %>%
    filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
    select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date) %>%
    arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
	as.data.frame()
```

The distribution of the number of games by a player,
leaving out the outliers (players who played more than 10 games)
as well as players who never won (i.e. only played one game):

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    summarise(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
    filter(MaxNumGames > 1 & MaxNumGames < 11) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(MaxNumGames))) +
        # geom_bar(binwidth=0.10, stat="count") + xlab("NumGamesPlayed") +
        geom_bar() + xlab("NumGamesPlayed") +
        coord_flip() +
        ggtitle("Counts of Number of Games Played by a Player")
```

Most winners only win once and winning more than 5 games is rare.

#### Total Winnings Per Player 

Here we look at the total winnings for player over all the
games she or he played.
The number of wins is one less than the number of times on the show.

Here are the winnings for the players who won 10 or more games:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    summarise(Name = first(Name), MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow),
        Date = max(Date), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
    filter(MaxNumGames >= 10) %>%
    select(Name, MaxNumGames, Date, Dollars) %>%
    arrange(desc(MaxNumGames), desc(Date)) %>%
	as.data.frame()
```

The total winninges versus number of games played for players who won less than 10 games
(we use jitter to better visualize the data in each group):

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
group_by(jeopardyData, PlayerId) %>%
    mutate(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
    summarise(Wins = first(NumberWins), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
    filter(Wins > 0) %>%
    filter(Wins < 10) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Wins, y=Dollars)) +
        geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .3)) +
        ggtitle("Total Amount Won by a Player versus Number of Games Played")
```

Alternatively, we could use boxplots for the same data:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    mutate(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
    summarise(Wins = first(NumberWins), Dollars = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
    filter(Wins > 0) %>%
    filter(Wins < 10) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Wins, y=Dollars)) +
        geom_boxplot(aes(group = Wins)) +
        ggtitle("Boxplots of Amount Won by a Player versus Number of Games Played")
```

### Ken Jennings

The player with longest winning streak, 74 games
(the 75th game was a loss):

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(PlayerId) %>%
    mutate(MaxNumGames = max(NumTimesOnShow)) %>%
    filter(MaxNumGames == 75) %>%
    summarise(NumberWins = n() - 1) %>%
	as.data.frame()
```

Ken Jennings won
`r filter(jeopardyData,
    PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah",
        NumTimesOnShow < 75) %>%
    summarise(TotalWinnings = sum(FinalScore)) %>%
	pull() %>%
    format(scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")`
dollars in his 75 games.

The final scores in the game he lost:

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(Show) %>%
    filter("Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah"
        %in% PlayerId, any(NumTimesOnShow == 75)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(Name, FinalScore) %>%
        arrange(desc(FinalScore)) %>%
		as.data.frame()
```

His winnings by game:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
filter(jeopardyData,
    PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah",
    NumTimesOnShow < 75) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=FinalScore)) + geom_point() +
    xlab("Date in 2004") +
    ggtitle("Ken Jennings Winnings by Date of Game")
```

Jennings percent correct in each game:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
filter(jeopardyData,
    PlayerId == "Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah") %>%
    mutate(PercentCorrect =
        (right + ddright) / (right + wrong + ddwrong + ddright) * 100) %>%
    with(summary(PercentCorrect))
```
    
How often did Jennings win in a runaway?

```{r}
jeopardyData %>%
    group_by(show) %>%
    filter("Ken Jennings.software engineer.Salt Lake City.Utah"
        %in% PlayerId, all(NumTimesOnShow < 75)) %>%
    summarise(Runaway = isRunaway(SecondRoundScore)) %>%
    with(c(NumberRunaways=sum(Runaway),
        PercentRunaways=round(sum(Runaway) / length(Runaway)  * 100, 2)))
```

## Players by State

Where do Jeopardy players come from?
While there are players from countries other than the United States,
the vast majority are from the U.S.

The number of players from each state;

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
NPlayers <- table(jeopardyData$State)
stateDF <- data.frame(State = names(NPlayers),
    NPlayers = c(NPlayers)) %>%
    filter(State %in% c(state.name, "D.C."))
ggplot(stateDF, aes(x=NPlayers,
        y=ordered(State, levels=State[order(NPlayers)]))) +
        geom_point() + xlab("Number of Players") + ylab("State") +
        ggtitle("Number of Players by State")
```

The state with more people tend to have more players on Jeopardy.
To make more appropriate comparisons, we need state population data.

State population data was downloaded from the U.S. Census
http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2012/tables/NST-EST2012-01.csv.
The CSV file includes aggregation data at the top and population values
for multiple years.
We only extracted the data for the 50 states and the District of Columbia
and only used the 2010 values.

```{r}
# URL <- "http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2012/tables/NST-EST2012-01.csv"
# censusTmpFile <- tempfile()
# download.file(URL, destfile=censusTmpFile)
# popPipe <- pipe(paste0("sed -n -e '/Alabama/,/Wyoming/p' ", censusTmpFile, " | cut -d'\"' --output-delimiter=\";\" -f1-2 | sed -e 's/\"//' -e 's/^.//' -e 's/,//g'"))
# statePop <- read.table(popPipe, sep=";", col.names=c("State", "Population"),
#     stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
statePop <- read.csv("pop_by_state_2017.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
statePop[statePop$State == "District of Columbia", "State"] <- "D.C."
indx51 <- match(stateDF$State, statePop$State)
stateDF$Population <- statePop[indx51, "Population"]
```

The number of players versus the state population:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
ggplot(data=stateDF, aes(x=Population, y=NPlayers)) + 
    geom_point() + xlab("State Population") +
    geom_text(data=subset(stateDF,
        State %in% c("New York", "D.C.", "Texas", "Florida")),
        aes(Population, NPlayers, label=State, vjust=1.3, hjust=0.2)) +
    geom_text(data=subset(stateDF,
        State %in% c("California")),
        aes(Population, NPlayers, label=State, vjust=1.3, hjust=0.8)) +
    ggtitle("Number of Players versus State Population")
```

As we noted earlier,
the bigger the state's population, the more players from that state.
Texas and Florida have the second and fourth largest population but
a low number of players and D.C. with a small population,
has a disproportionate number of players.

To see if players are equally likely to come from any U.S. state,
we want to compare the number of players from each state
to the state's population.
We add a standardized number of players per million people in a state to the
`stateDF` dataset:

```{r}
stateDF$PlayersPerMillion <- with(stateDF, NPlayers/Population * 1e6)
```

The number of players standardized by state's population (on log2 scale):

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
ggplot(data=stateDF, aes(x=log2(PlayersPerMillion),
    y=ordered(State, levels=State[order(stateDF$PlayersPerMillion)]))) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Number of Players / 1 Million Population") + ylab("State") +
    ggtitle("Number of Players Standardized by State Population")
```

The East coast and West Coast is very well represented
after adjusting for population.
The Midwest is mostly in the middle and the South and plains states are
under represented.
